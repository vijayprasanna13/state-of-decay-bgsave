# State of Decay Save Manager
Take backup saves for every 10 mins of the game so that you don't rage quit when a character perma-dies in game. (R.I.P Maya)

# How to run this
 - Install Python3 on your system
 - Install `qt5` via `pip`
 - Change the paths for your steam's save location and you backup save location in `main.py`
 - Run `python main.py` 
 - You should get a dialog box with the option to start the process of saving
 - Click on `start` and play the game
 - The save frequency can be modified in the `main.py` file.

# Plans
Probably make this more usable.
